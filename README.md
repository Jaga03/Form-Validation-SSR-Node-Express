# 🧾 HTML Form Validation using Node.js and Express

This is a basic full-stack form submission project built with:

- ✅ HTML for the frontend with inline JavaScript validation
- ✅ Node.js + Express for backend server-side validation
- ✅ In-memory storage for submitted and validated form data

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS (inline or internal)
- JavaScript (inline for validation)
- Node.js
- Express.js

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Rich form with fields like Name, Email, Age, Password
- ✅ Inline JavaScript for client-side validation (e.g., empty fields, age check, password length)
- ✅ Express server for server-side validation and error handling
- ✅ Temporary in-memory storage for validated users
- ✅ `/data` route to view submitted data in HTML table format

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Form-Validation-Node-Express.git
cd Form-Validation-Node-Express

2. Install dependencies
npm install

3. Start the server
node server.js

4. Open your browser
http://localhost:5000

🧪 How It Works
Form is rendered from static HTML.

JavaScript runs in-browser for basic client-side validation.

On submission, form data is POSTed to the backend.

Express validates server-side (e.g., no missing fields, valid email).

If valid, data is stored in a temporary array.

You can view all submissions at /users.

Would you like me to generate the complete `index.html` (with inline validation) and `server.js` (with server-side validation + temporary storage + `/users` route) to match this README?
